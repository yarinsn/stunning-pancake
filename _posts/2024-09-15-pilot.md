The first step in my journey of building something using GenAI started with just conversing with ChatGPT about what it is that I'm trying to achieve.

I asked for project ideas, and the one that stood out for me was an app that gamifies carbon emissions reduction by presenting its users with challenges.

I’m hoping that the process of writing a blog will force me to be clear about what to do and how.

So I looked for a blogging platform, and decided to go with github pages. I found a <a href="https://github.com/skills/github-pages" target="_blank">tutorial</a> and created this blog you are reading right now. It still needs some tweaking, but it was up and running within 10 mins or so. I am now writing the blog posts on google docs for the spell and grammar checks, and then making the changes from my local VS code and pushing them to the blog’s github repository using git.
